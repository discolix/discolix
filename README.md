Discolix
========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/discolix/discolix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/discolix/discolix)

"Distroless" docker images for ARM. Discolix is based on the 
[GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) 
project, but with a focus on support for popular ARM platforms.

The basic idea is to provide "distroless" language focused images for the `arm`, 
`arm64` and `amd64` architectures where the `amd64` image can serve as a drop-in 
replacement with it's upstream variant.
